Next Generation HHVM Binary Packaging
=====================================

All linux builds will be in Docker containers, on AWS.

Configuration
=============

Distribution subdirectories should be consistently named: `DISTRO-NUMERIC_VERSION[-VERSION_NAME]` - for example, `debian-9-stretch`, or `ubuntu-16.04-xenial`. There are two required files:
 - `make-package`: executable script that creates a package from `/var/out/hhvm-nightly-$VERSION.tar.gz`, and put the output in `/var/out`
 - `DOCKER_BASE`: plain text file containing the name of a public docker image that should be used for the build - for example, `debian:stretch`. It needs to be possible to pass this to `docker run`, for example, `docker run -it debian:stretch /bin/bash -l` should work.

Docker containers will have the following directories bind-mounted:

 - `/var/out`: read-write; build artifacts (e.g. packages) go here.
 - `/opt/hhvm-packaging`: read-only; this directory.
 - `/opt/hhvm-distro-packaging`: read-only; the subdirectory for your
   distribution. This should contain a `make-package` script or symlink

For example, when building for Debian Jessie, the `debian-8-jessie/`
subdirectory is mounted to /opt/hhvm-distro-packaging.

The package building process will execute
`/opt/hhvm-distro-packaging/make-package` in the container, and will
expect that to create packages in `/var/out`. `make-package` should install
all required build dependencies. Use the native package manager's support
for `build-depends` or similar where possible.

Debian-like distributions
-------------------------

You probably want `make-package` to be a symlink to `/opt/hhvm-packaging/bin/make-debianish-package`; this expects:

 - a `DISTRIBUTION` file containing the string name for the distribution - e.g. 'jessie', 'trusty'
 - a `PKGVER` file containing the *package* version - e.g. `1~jessie`
 - a `debian/` subdirectory, containing `control`, `rules`, etc.

If you are able to use an existing distribution's `debian/` directory directly, please make it a symlink to
`/opt/hhvm-packaging/OTHER_DISTRO_HERE/debian`.

Packages will be build with `debbuild`

Local interactive usage
=======================

1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
2. run `bin/make-interactive-container`; you now have a shell in the container
3. within the container, install git (e.g. `apt-get update -y; apt-get install -y git`)
4. run `/opt/hhvm-packaging/bin/make-source-tarball`
5. run `/opt/hhvm-distro-packaging/make-package`

You can specify a distribution at step 2 - for example, `bin/interactive-container debian-9-stretch'

Building packages non-interactively
===================================

1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
2. If you are on MacOS, `brew install gnu-tar`, and `export TAR=gtar`
3. `bin/make-source-tarball` (just once)
4. run `bin/make-package-in-throwaway-container DISTRO_ID` (for each distribution)

`DISTRO_ID` is the name of one of the distribution-specific subdirectories, e.g. `debian-9-stretch`.

AWS
===

As we want to execute docker commands, we run directly on EC2, not ECS. AWS
supports running commands on EC2 instance startup - EC2 calls this
'user data' - a file or script-as-text in 'user data' will be executed.

The scripts we use are in the `aws/` subdirectory, and expect to be ran on
Ubuntu 16.04 hosts.

Building source tarball and linux packages for new releases
-----------------------------------------------------------

 - tag the release on the `hhvm-staging` repo
 - `bin/build-on-aws VERSION`

If you just need to rebuild for one distribution, with no code changes:

 - edit `DISTRO/PKGVER` if needed (e.g. if a previous package was pushed for this HHVM version and distribution) and push to github
 - `bin/build-on-aws VERSION DISTRO`

Building source tarballs and linux packages for multiple new releases
-----------------------------------------------------------

The common case is fixing a bug in multiple releases - for example, the current
release and all active LTS releases - simultaneously.

 - tag all the releases on the `hhvm-staging` repo
 - `bin/build-on-aws VERSION1 [VERSION2 [...]]`

How it works
------------

There are 3 kinds of jobs used here:

- AWS lambdas: code that can be written in stateless javascript/python
- jobs that run on EC2 instances: any other code. For example, building HHVM, or updating apt repositories
- AWS step functions: these are state machines, which coordinate the previous steps

See [aws/hhvm1/README.md](aws/hhvm1/README.md) for more details.

Nightly builds are triggered by a CloudWatch scheduled event rule.

S3 Buckets
----------

- `hhvm-downloads`: public. This is `dl.hhvm.com`
- `hhvm-scratch`: private. build artifacts and release source tarballs before public

EC2 Jobs
--------

Each kind of EC2 job has distinct 'userdata'; this is a shell script that AWS will invoke when imaged. You can see these in `aws/userdata/`.
Some of them depend on environment variables being set - this is accomplished by using lambdas to spawn them, which prepend variable initialization
to the userdata script before passing it to the EC2 API.

Note: The `userdata` scripts are no longer run directly on EC2 startup, they are now passed as "tasks" to "workers".
See [aws/hhvm1/README.md](aws/hhvm1/README.md) for more details.

Currently these are:

1. `make-source-tarball.sh`: creates and signs source tarballs.
   - if this is a nightly build (version like `YYYY.MM.DD`), it will create the tarball from the `master` branch of `facebook/hhvm`, and immediately publish to the `hhvm-downloads` S3 bucket
   - if this is a release build (any other version format), it will create the tarball from the appropriate `HHVM-x.y.z` tag  of `hhvm/hhvm-staging`, and instead upload to the `hhvm-scratch` S3 bucket
1. `make-binary-package.sh`: create a distribution packages (e.g `.deb` for Debian or Ubuntu) for a specific distribution and distribution version - e.g. `Ubuntu 16.04` will be built on a separate instance to `Ubuntu 16.10`. Results are published to the `hhvm-scratch` bucket
1. `update-repos.sh`: update the apt repositories or similar: this moves the binaries from `hhvm-scratch` to `hhvm-downloads`
1. `publish-release-source.sh`:
   - for nightlies, this does nothing
   - for release builds, this copies the source to `s3://hhvm-downloads/source/`, and copies the branch and tag from `hhvm/hhvm-staging` to `facebook/hhvm`

Lambdas
-------

There's a lot of these; the best way to see how these fit together is to look at the step function defintions. They take JSON input, and produce JSON output.
As step functions work like a pipeline, the output usually contains all the input data, but with fields added or modified. If a field isn't relevant to the lambda,
the lambda should return it verbatim.

If you want to invoke them manually:

```
aws lambda invoke --function-name my-func-name --payload "$(pbpaste)" /dev/stdout
```

... assuming the JSON input is in your clipboard, and you're on mac. Otherwise, replace `"$(pbpaste)"` with the JSON payload.

But more likely you just want:

```
bin/build-on-aws StepName ...
```

which starts an AWS state machine that invokes the correct combination of lambdas to perform the specified build step(s).

Currently, these are:

- `hhvm-get-build-status`: this is the code behind https://hhvm.com/api/build-status/VERSION (also used from some scripts and other lambdas)
- `create-s3-index-html`: takes an S3 bucket ID, and automatically generates `index.html` files
- `hhvm-invalidate-repository-metadata-on-cloudfront`: optionally takes a version number, but it's unused except for a job ID. It purges all `apt` metadata from the CDN caches.
  This is usually a final step in the build process.
- see [aws/hhvm1/README.md](aws/hhvm1/README.md) for information about other lambdas
  (meant to be only triggered from the build state machine)

Resuming Failed Step Functions
------------------------------

`bin/build-on-aws` automatically checks which steps need to run and which are
already completed, so re-running it with the same parameters (after fixing the
issue that caused it to fail) should resume where it left off.

Debugging Issues With Lambdas
-----------------------------

The step function output includes an 'Exception' tab. If it's not useful, follow the links to 'cloudwatch logs' on the info tab.

See also [aws/hhvm1/README.md](aws/hhvm1/README.md) for more debugging options.
